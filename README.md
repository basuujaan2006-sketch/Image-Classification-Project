## Image Classification Project (MNIST)

## Overview
This mini-project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **handwritten digits (0–9)** from the **MNIST dataset**.

It is a part of the **AI/ML specialization in B.Tech CSE** course.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Colab


##  How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.  
2. Run each cell in order (Shift + Enter).  
3. The model will train and display:
   - Accuracy and Loss Graphs  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Sample Predictions  

##  Results
The CNN achieves over **97–99% accuracy** on test data.  
Graphs and confusion matrix show how well the model classifies handwritten digits.
